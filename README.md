# SmartHysteresis

This repo contains codes for the paper: Discovering sparse hysteresis models for piezoelectric materials (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05313)

To run codes one would need to install pysindy library (https://pysindy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

which could be installed using the command 

pip install pysindy

and then one could run the codes through

python3 name.py

for example to run the first experiment present in the paper 

python3 Exp1_Duhem_Simulated.py

and so on.

also for some codes where comparison with DNN has been made, PyTorch would be needed (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Compatible version of PyTorch and its corresponding download instructions can be found on the PyTorch link above.
