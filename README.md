# SmartHysteresis

This repo contains code for the paper: Discovering sparse hysteresis models for smart materials (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05313)

To run codes one would need to install pysindy library (https://pysindy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

and then one could run the codes through

python3 name.py

also for some codes where comparison with DNN has been made, PyTorch would be needed (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
